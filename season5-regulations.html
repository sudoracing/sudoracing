                            <li><strong>On Track Behaviour</strong>
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>The Driver in front has the right to choose any line at any section of the track. The Driver in front loses this right when an overtaking Driver brings their front wheel to line up with the other Driver’s rear wheel. At this point drivers are in a “side-by-side” or “overlap” position, and they both have to give each other at least 1 car’s width of room</li>
                                    <li>Defending is allowed and accepted as a reaction by the Driver in front. It is not allowed to defend if there is any overlap between cars. Note that following a racing line into a corner is not considered defence (unless cars are deemed side-by-side)</li>
                                    <li>Both the passing Driver and the Driver in front are responsible for fair racing during the pass. It is the passing driver’s responsibility to choose a safe timing for the pass</li>
                                    <li>Pass attempts at a turn is what causes most accidents. The preferred racing line through most corners is usually very narrow and sometimes it will be impossible for two cars to share tight corners side-by-side at full speed. For each corner, the right to the preferred racing line is decided at the turn-in point. A Driver attempting to pass at corner entry has to be in a side-by-side position at the turn-in point to have a right to enter the corner side-by-side. If not, this Driver must back off and give way to the driver up front</li>
                                    <li>Dive-bombing without establishing sufficient overlap before the turn-in point should be avoided and may be subject to a penalty. If the attempting Driver gets out of control and causes contact, or time loss to another Driver, the penalties applied may be harsher than normal</li>
                                    <li>Brake checking, unnecessary slowing through a corner, punting, bump-passing, cutting-off or chopping, whether there is contact or not, are not permitted and will be subject to penalty</li>
                                    <li>Blocking is not allowed and subject to a penalty</li>
                                    <li>Weaving to break a draft is considered blocking</li>
                                    <li>Out-of-control or spinning Drivers should lock their brakes to make it easier for other Drivers to predict their movements. After a spin, the driver must keep the brakes pressed to make sure the car does not roll forward or back in order to not create an unpredictable situation for cars passing by. Rolling back to or recklessly re-entering the racing line and causing additional incidents may be subject to severe penalty, whether or not the offending car was the source of the initial incident</li>
                                    <li>Drivers who go off track limits, if they can keep their cars under control, should slow down or wait for traffic to clear and re-join in a safe manner</li>
                                    <li>Flashing of lights is permitted to alert the Driver ahead you are about to pass or Driver ahead will give way to help the pass. It cannot be more than 3 repeat flashes</li>
                                    <li>Gaining a position or gaining an advantage against a competitor or gaining track position (gaining time) by leaving the track in any way is against the rules, regardless of any in-game penalty that may be handed out, and the Stewards may apply penalties because of that, unless the Driver gives back the position immediately or slows down to compensate within the same lap</li>
                                    <li>Bump drafting is also prohibited. Drivers shall provide racing room to each other</li>
                                </ol>

                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>The Sudo league is focused on having fun. Currently we do not routinely operate a penalty system (based on “On Track Behaviour” section) and operate on trust with the understanding mistakes will happen from time to time</li>
                                    <li>The “On Track Behaviour” section is for all of us to know what we expect from each other</li>
                                    <li>If a driver is involved in an incident they feel they’re responsible for, it is encouraged that the driver apply the “Gentleman’s Rule” (GR). This is the online racing equivalent of saying “my fault, sorry”. It simply means that you safely stop or safely drive slower than normal until the car that you may have harmed has passed you again.
                                        <ol type="i">
                                            <li>While applying the GR rule, if the car you're waiting for has returned to pits, given up, etc then alternatively as long as you’ve slowed down enough (e.g. 5s or let a different car pass) it can be classified as if the GR rule was applied. This signals to everyone the incident was accidental and you’re not capitalising on the gained advantage</li>
                                            <li>It is expected for Sudo league members to follow the GR rule whether or not the other driver is a Sudo member or not (e.g. a public race)</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Antagonising any other driver due to an incident (mistake or not) is strictly prohibited. Attempt to educate and improve each other rather than seek blame/justice. Opinions may differ, avoid escalating any encounters</li>
                                    <li>If a driver repeatedly violates rules, Stewards will speak to the driver in question. Please remember we are focused on having fun. If you want a more serious league, there are plenty out there. If issues persist penalties may be utilized at the discretion of the Stewards. The Stewards will take into account if the GR rule was applied or not</li>
                                    <li>The Stewards have the right to give any driver (but not limited to) penalties, disqualifications, bans or point reductions for any reason. We prefer not to, please remember we are focused on having some fun</li>
                                    <li>If you have any concerns of any driver, please speak to an Steward at least 24 hours after the race (cooldown):

                                            <li>Please keep any reports objective, simply provide evidence (replay file, lap/timestamp and cars involved etc). Do this as a last resort for repeated offences. Do not try to influence a Steward decision</li>
                                            <li>The Sudo league is focused on having fun. Attempt to educate and improve each other rather than seek blame/justice before raising issues with the Stewards</li>

                                    <li>A Steward can deem a driver as a DNF (Did Not Finish) if (but not limited to) how many laps they are behind, whether or not they have retired to the pits, etc. You have to participate in the race until the end with best endeavours</li>
