                                    <li>We strongly follow <a href="https://f1metrics.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/the-rules-of-racing/">https://f1metrics.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/the-rules-of-racing/</a> with regards to apex disputes</li>
                                    <li>There is no such thing as a racing line when there is traffic involved. Racing line is for when there is no traffic</li>
                                    <li>If a car is next to you (at least half a car alongside) before a braking zone, they have the right to be there when the corner comes up. They should leave you room and you should leave them room (which will normally mean you both will go slower than usual). Either of you are allowed to safely back out but are not obliged to. Please see <a href="https://f1metrics.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/the-rules-of-racing/">https://f1metrics.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/the-rules-of-racing/</a> for more information</a></li>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        If you leave the track (all 4 wheels outside of the white line) you must rejoin the track safely, this will mean:
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>You must be in control of the car, rather than just pointing the car to the road and hoping for the best</li>
                                            <li>Once joined the track, you must stay predictable if there are cars near you. Especially when your going slower. You must not impede other drivers while you are recovering to the track</li>
                                            <li>You must only rejoin the track if it is safe to do so, you must not cause another car to take avoiding action to prevent contact</li>
                                            <li>You are deemed to have recovered to the track once you have regained full control of the vehicle, reached a safe speed for that part of the track and are on a predictable line</li>
                                            <li>You should wait until a reasonable opportunity arises to enter the track. If an approaching car has a reasonable ability to give you room (IE they are not approaching or exiting a corner) you can rejoin the track with caution. If they are fighting for position against another car you should let them pass</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        If you see another car off-track:
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>If a car is off-track you should take reasonable steps to ensure there is track space for them to rejoin the track. e.g: If they went off track to the left, then go to the right side of the road if possible</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>

                                <strong>BLOCKING / WEAVING</strong>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Any driver defending his position on a straight, and before any braking area, may use the full width of the track during his first move, provided no significant portion of the car attempting to pass is alongside his</li>
                                    <li>More than one change of direction to defend a position is not permitted</li>
                                    <li>When a defender makes their one move, the distance and closing speed of the attacker may also be considered by the stewards. If the attacker is closing quickly and is only a short distance behind, then they may not have time to evade a sudden move into their path. It is at the stewards’ discretion whether or not to punish late defensive moves</li>
                                    <li>A second move is permitted when it is part of their racing line for the corner that follows the straight. This allows the driver to pick up a more favourable racing line at corner entry. The driver however must leave at least one car width between themselves and the edge of the track</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>

                            <li>If a driver is involved in an incident they feel they may be responsible for initiating, it is encouraged that the offending driver apply the “Gentleman’s Rule” (GR). This is the online racing equivalent of saying “my fault, sorry”. It simply means that you safely stop or drive slower than normal until the car that you may have harmed has passed you again</li>
                            <li>Drivers whom the Stewards clearly observe applying the GR after an incident may be assessed a reduction in penalty if one is applied</li>
                            <li>If a driver causes significant damage to the other vehicle, a GR may not be sufficient and the stewards may impose additional penalties as appropriate</li>
                            <li>Some leagues may not have implemented the steward-based penalty system yet, however the GR rule still applies</li>
